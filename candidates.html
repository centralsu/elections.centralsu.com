									<li>Creating more tailored events for Freshers by understanding the wants/needs of them based on my own experiences as well as through seeking feedback from other students on their freshers experiences. Also improving send off/end of year events for all courses especially those that are graduating or leaving Central by monitoring each course’s start and finish dates and engaging with course leaders and students from each course and year.</li>

But also bringing more events such as karaoke, film nights, lip syncs and sporting events to name just a few. </p>

Equally I won’t make empty promises. Inclusion is a work in progress. I can’t, single handedly, start up something for everyone, but what I will do is work with and for those students among us that are passionate about creating brave spaces, where they can find comfort and companionship or somewhere just to switch off from the hustle and bustle of central life. I do whole heartedly believe it’s within my power to accomplish my goals. Before moving to London I volunteered at my local rugby club to help run one of their rugby teams. So i’ve organised christmas markets, presentation evenings, charity events and many a good piss up! I want to be your platform to being bridging the gaps among central’s community, supporting and celebrating our differences starting off the year with one heck of a freshers week, because no-one throws a party like a northerner! </p>

								<p class="card-text">Hiya :) I'm CJ and I practically live in the backstage bar so most of you have probably seen me around. </p>
								<p class="card-text">As most of you are probably aware, the SU took a major step back recently and has pretty much removed any form of inclusivity by reducing all minority groups into one role that is the inclusion officer. This is a ridiculous motion that never should have been put through but here we are now. </p>
								<p class="card-text">If elected I will work diligently with the Inclusion Officer to ensure that accessibility remains top priority. I also want to increase the inclusivity of the events on offer (such as more queer caberets and better worded disability events...). </p>
								<p class="card-text">The events currently on offer in no way appeal to all and seem to centre a lot around drinking so I want to introduce a wider range of events on offer. </p>
								<h5 class="card-text mt-4">What changes do you want to see at Central and think you could get done in a year?</h6>

								<h5>Aims for the year</h5>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Start something new:</strong> To ask the student body what new societies they would like to see and work collaboratively in the creation of them</li>
									<li><strong>Creating communities:</strong> Work with other officers on creating events to repair the community within Central</li>
									<li><strong>Back to normal:</strong> To get the societies that existed pre-COVID up and running again</li>
									<li><strong>Keeping going:</strong> Ensure all societies have prolonged success by remaining in close contact with the presidents</li>
									<li><strong>Spreading the word:</strong> Have a key focus on advertising and promoting societies</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Hey! We’re Mia and Kate, pronouns both she/her! We’re aware that life at a drama school can be full on, demanding and full of many hours spent slaving away in a studio. We believe there needs to be some respite from this; some time that is spent doing something else that we enjoy, but doing it purely for fun! The societies at Central have the potential to be that respite for students, and we want to make them more of a priority within the school.<br><br>
								Societies are a place where any course and year can come together and dedicate time to something where there is a mutual enjoyment. We are aware that there is often a divide between courses and that was made even more prominent in the last year with the COVID pandemic. Each course had been physically made to stay apart from each other for over a year, and we want to help integrate everybody again. These societies can massively help with getting people to meet each other and create connections between courses. We have seen through working with the football team this year that these societies have the potential to create new connections and friendships, in this instance, between the players and supporters. We want to make sure that this support remains throughout the season, as well as getting the netball team up and running again, and to make sure they have an equal amount of support!<br><br>
								We also recognise that the societies often don’t have much advertisement, therefore not many people know what is on offer and don’t get to make the most of them. We want to make sure everybody knows what is available and we also want students to be able to come to us and propose other societies that they would like; we will be here to support them and help them get started!</p>

								<h5>Aims for the year</h5>

									<li>Increased accessibility</li>

								</ul>
								<p>Hi everyone! I’m CJ and I will be runinng for the role of activities officer.<br><br>
								Before we get onto the more serious manifesto points I’ll tell you three random racts that you don’t need to know;<br><br>
								- I refuse the watch Christmas films before November (proper bad luck I promise)<br>
								- I did baby hiphop and won world with a cheeky little Beyonce piece<br>
								- I used to drive a yellow Corsa that set on fire while I was driving it (always check you coolant fluid kids)<br><br>
								Unnecessary but the more you know, I guess.<br><br>
								Now, more than ever, the positive mental wellbeing of students should be of top priority and so I aim to promote connectivity at Central. I want to create a space in which everyone has the opportunity to feel heard.<br><br>
								I wish to work with the Environments Officer to encourage sustainability – even small changes can make a huge difference.<br><br>
								Increased accessibility is so important and so I want to try and ensure all students feel that there are options which they truly wish to participate in. This is an ideal time in our lives to try new things in a forward-thinking environment that could shape who we become.<br><br>
								I want to promote new creative experiences that are unique to Central. We are all in this together and so I wan to be a point of contact for anyone with an idea for a new society, event or charity fundraiser so that everyone has a chance to communicate their ideas.<br><br>
								The next 3+ years of our life are so excitign and so I want to contribute to this by providing an outlet from all our hard work where we can simply make the most of it all.<br><br>
								One point that has recently come to the attention of the media is the increased rates of spiking in clubs and the dangerous methods of spiking now occuring. For everyone’s saety I think this point needs to be addressed and so I want to increase awareness and discover new prevention methods so that we can all enjoy nightlife without fearing for our safety. This is a very important matter to me and so if elected, it will be one of my first points made.<br><br>
								Thanks for reading :)<br>

								<h5 class="card-text mt-4">Who are you and why would you be good for the role?</h6>
								<p class="card-text">The student unions responsibility is to amplify the voices of all students and advocate for their needs, wants and rights. Central is a problematic institution, so the role of inclusion officer is key to ensuring the SU can fulfil its purpose. My aim is to liaise closely with inclusion representatives to ensure every community and minority group has its opinions heard and respected. The recent restructuring of the SU has caused anxiety surrounding the culminating of multiple minorities officers roles, so as inclusion officer it’s paramount that in every conversation inclusion is considered. Whilst I am a part of multiple minority groups, I recognise I have many privileges, which is why its of the highest importance to me that the inclusion representatives are given a seat at every table I am at, to represent their communities as they know best. My number one aim is to create a supporting environment for students to advocate for their rights to an equitable environment at university where they feel celebrated and included. </p>

								<p class="card-text">Hey! I’m Mia, my pronouns are she/her/hers and I am currently a 3rd year DATE student. I am also the elected activities officer for the student union, meaning that I have responsibilities to oversee all active societies across Central, as well as all events that are held in or outside of the Backstage Bar. I believe the work I have done on events and the summer ball showcases my abilities of organisation, budget handling and people management. Having worked consistently for the student union this past year and closely alongside the current president has given me an Indepth insight to the current structure and operations of the SU. Allowing me to be able to analyse what factors are effective and what may need closer attention to ensure the adequate function of our Student union. I believe the student union should be a place where we can work together to demand change, but also come together to celebrate each other's successes and really be united. </p>
								<h5 class="card-text mt-4">What changes do you want to see at Central and think you could get done in a year?</h6>
								<ol>
									<li>Work with the new structure of the SU, particularly to ensure that the representation is still upheld day-to-day for communities that aren't physically represented by the smaller SU team, in order to make sure the SU is still advocating for all students. This includes making sure the inclusion reps are properly organised and made aware of to the student body. </li>
									<li>Change the way the SU is viewed. Of course, the most important task of the student union is to create change in order to achieve comfort and equality for every student at central. But I also want to make sure the SU is celebrating the work students are doing both on their course and off. Therefore I want to further establish the Student Union as a hub for student culture while maintaining its work in fighting for better student policy. </li>
									<li>I want to ensure that we, as the union, can become more accessible for all students to use and clearly understand how the SU can support them as central students. This can be achieved by advancing recognition for both the SU and the president through being more visible and present throughout the student community. Resulting in a more cohesive relationship between students and the union. I want all students to feel like they know their union officers and can reach out to them for anything they need </li>

								<p class="card-text">Hi! I'm Nathan, and I want to help raise the performance level of the SU and make your voices heard loudly by Central. By working closely with the new inclusion rep system and revamped course committee, running the events that you want to see put on, and showcasing the work you create in and out of Central, I want you to feel heard when you express concerns, and to ensure you can express your interests. I've been course rep for the past year, and with my previous experience organising events and sitting on committees, I believe I have the logistical expertise for the role. I'm eager to elevate the efficiency and transparency of Central’s responses to feedback because this is your university, and my sole focus is on making sure you see the changes that you want, both campus-wide and within your course. </p>
								<h5 class="card-text mt-4">What changes do you want to see at Central and think you could get done in a year?</h6>
								<ol>
									<li>Finding ways to speed up Central's response to feedback </li>
									<li>Creating and publicising a more coherent events calendar across the year </li>
									<li>Showing off and celebrating the work of students through regular social media posts </li>

								<h5 class="card-text mt-4">Who are you and why would you be good for the role?</h6>
								<p class="card-text">This is where I do the cringey introduction right?? The whole “I’m Joe, 1st Year DATE etc, etc”. Well there’s a 150 word limit and I’ve already wasted plenty of them trying to be clever with the introduction so I’ll cut to the chase.</p>
								<p class="card-text">Since joining Central I’ve loved meeting everyone here and I’m finishing this year thinking to myself “okay mate, what’s next, how can you help make Central a great place for students”. Hence I’m hoping to be your SU vice-president.</p>
								<p class="card-text">I’d like to support the president, SU team and all Central students in feeling like we have an SU we can depend on to deliver a brilliant student experience. If you ask me, a great student experience needs aspirational ideas of what can be achieved, hard work to make them happen and fun along the way (the fun is really important! Let’s not forget the fun).</p>
								<h5 class="card-text mt-4">What changes do you want to see at Central and think you could get done in a year?</h6>
								<ol>
									<li>To support all students in having their voices, views and opinions heard and honoured by the SU. </li>
									<li>Support the SU in becoming much more responsive and proactive. </li>
									<li>By the end of the year, I’d hope everyone walks away at the end of the school year saying “our SU is boss” </li>
