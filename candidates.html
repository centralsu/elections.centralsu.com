									Hey! We’re Mia and Kate, pronouns both she/her! We’re aware that life at a drama school can be full on, demanding and full of many hours spent slaving away in a studio. We believe there needs to be some respite from this; some time that is spent doing something else that we enjoy, but doing it purely for fun! The societies at Central have the potential to be that respite for students, and we want to make them more of a priority within the school.
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									Societies are a place where any course and year can come together and dedicate time to something where there is a mutual enjoyment. We are aware that there is often a divide between courses and that was made even more prominent in the last year with the COVID pandemic. Each course had been physically made to stay apart from each other for over a year, and we want to help integrate everybody again. These societies can massively help with getting people to meet each other and create connections between courses. We have seen through working with the football team this year that these societies have the potential to create new connections and friendships, in this instance, between the players and supporters. We want to make sure that this support remains throughout the season, as well as getting the netball team up and running again, and to make sure they have an equal amount of support!
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									We also recognise that the societies often don’t have much advertisement, therefore not many people know what is on offer and don’t get to make the most of them. We want to make sure everybody knows what is available and we also want students to be able to come to us and propose other societies that they would like; we will be here to support them and help them get started!</p>

								<p class="card-text">
									- I refuse the watch Christmas films before November (proper bad luck I promise)<br>
									- I did baby hiphop and won worlds with a cheeky little Beyonce piece<br>

									I wish to work with the Environments Officer to encourage sustainability – even small changes can make a huge difference.

									Increased accessibility is so important and so I want to try and ensure all students feel that there are options which they truly wish to participate in. This is an ideal time in our lives to try new things in a forward-thinking environment that could shape who we become.
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									I want to promote new creative experiences that are unique to Central. We are all in this together and so I want to be a point of contact for anyone with an idea for a new society, event or charity fundraiser so that everyone has a chance to communicate their ideas.

								<p class="card-text">
									The next 3+ years of our life are so exciting and so I want to contribute to this by providing an outlet from all our hard work where we can simply make the most of it all.
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									One point that has recently come to the attention of the media is the increased rates of spiking in clubs and the dangerous methods of spiking now occurring. For everyone’s safety I think this point needs to be addressed and so I want to increase awareness and discover new prevention methods so that we can all enjoy nightlife without fearing for our safety. This is a very important matter to me and so if elected, it will be one of my first points made.

								</ul>
								<p class="card-text">
									Hi, I’m Immie and I am super passionate about saving our planet! I know this can sometimes feel hard, or even impossible because it’s easy to feel out of control with the climate crisis. Truth is, although the main issue is with corporate companies primarily burning fossil fuels and dumping plastic into the ocean which have fundamentally increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere, we too can help contribute to the change as individuals. As your environments officer, I aim to tackle to climate emergency with a team of other passionate people in as many ways as we can. This will include events such as eco-friendly learning workshops, clothes trading sessions, quiz nights to test and improve our eco knowledge, guest speaker Q&As, marches/protests, small performances, competitions and more!
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									I also know that not everyone is an environmental expert, not even I am! However, part of my role would be helping people learn and grow together with a no-judgement, no-pressure and no-obligation approach. Too many people judge others on what they don’t know, or even do know. I am here simply to bring people together and work collectively to do some brilliant things this year. Anybody and everybody will be encouraged to attend the events I aim to create around the year, no matter who you are, how you identify, whether you’re already knowledgeable and passionate about the environment, or whether you know nothing about it. Let’s come together and make a change.

								<h5>Aims for the year</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>Creating a strong sense of community and network of support amongst Central’s LGBT+ students</li>
									<li>Regular events, targeting all letters of the acronym. Events open to all students and events exclusively for LGBT+ students to create a safer space – Including entertainment, events not centred around alcohol, workshops, talks and regular meet-ups</li>
									<li>Making the school and classroom a safer space for LGBT+ students, through campaigns and mandatory training on inclusivity and inclusive language for students and regular staff</li>
									<li>Working with administration and the Trans Officer to make registration and paperwork more inclusive; including but not limited to pronouns on IDs, Emails & forms, and simpler and safer registration for LGBT+ students</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="card-text">
									Our main focus this year is to bring back a strong sense of community and network for LGBT+ students, whose mental health statistically has been more negatively impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, than that of those who do not identify as LGBT+ (Source: KFF). We want to do this through regular events that both include the whole acronym but also target specific groups within the acronym, in order to provide safer spaces. Likewise we have a strong focus on overturning administrative processes and putting pressure on Central to take an active approach to inclusivity. Together, we want to decentre ourselves and use the platform to actively support and hand the mic to our fellow LGBT+ students – as well as listen and learn from our peers.
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									Hi, I’m Josefine, my pronouns are she/her and I’m a 2nd year Stage Management student. Outside of Central, I’m an editor of Denmark’s only printed LGBT+ magazine, HeartCore, where content contributors get a platform to write about themes and issues that are important to them – not just to the editors of the magazine. I want to transfer this mentality to the role as LGBT+ officer and use the privileges I benefit from to, together with Chloe, create a safer space within Central and within the LGBT+ community at Central for all students. Likewise, I’m very passionate about making stage management more inclusive and actively using my practice to walk the talk, every day.
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									Hi, I’m Chloe and my main focuses are being a positive and present influence on behalf of the LGBT+ community and to be a consistent voice for change and equality. Also, to be able to provide exciting opportunities and events which enable students to be expressive and creative. With my 3 years’ experience of being president of an LGBT+ society, I am fortunate enough to have been part of a platform that offered support, community, space to express, and fundraising. From this I feel like I have the right foundations, along with Josefine, to push for active encouragement in boosting centrals equality and inclusivity and providing a safer space for all students.

								<h5>Aims for the year</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>Ensuring that the role is undertaken with intersectionality as a priority, I want to work closely with BAME, Trans and Women’s officers and seek to fight discrimination within the Queer community as well as the school in its entirety</li>
									<li>Creating a platform for Queer art by implementing more queer cabarets, open mics and scratch nights</li>
									<li>A focus on education, with workshops on Queer history, positive allyship, and ensuring that all existing workshops are inclusive for the Queer community</li>
									<li>Creating friendly and accommodating spaces for members of the LGBTQ+ community to be together</li>
									<li>Creating a Queer community that exists outside of Central</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="card-text">
									As LGBTQ+ officer I wish to listen, learn and fight for voices to be heard, education and growth are paramount to creating an intersectional LGBTQ+ community at Central. With this being my priority, I aim to work as closely as possible with BAME, Trans and Women’s officers to ensure that intersectionality is seen as a leading force within my practice as LGBTQ+ officer and the community as a whole. Through working with other officers, I want to make the pre-existing workshops at Central inclusive and informative for LGBTQ+ students. The Queer community is not innocent of malpractice, and I want to ensure that consent modules include specific nuances that only exist within LGBTQ+ relationships. In addition to this, I would hold allyship workshops and workshops on specific issues within the LGBTQ+ community e.g., biphobia to ensure that all members of the LGBTQ+ community at Central feel supported and heard.
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									The LGBTQ+ community does not disappear into the abyss the morning after the fresher’s queer cabaret. We are a large and wonderful part of the student body that deserve to be celebrated and facilitated throughout the entirety of our studies at Central. I want to make events such as the Queer Cabaret a recurring part of the student union nightlife at the university, I want to hold a Queer Cabaret and an open mic once a month (meaning an event would take place every two weeks) not only to give performers the opportunity to showcase their talent, but to give other students a space to socialise within a positive and uplifting atmosphere.
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									However, Queer social life should not be limited to nights out and evening shows/events, I also want to implement other events/groups that are not centred around night life. For example, I would like to facilitate an LGBTQ+ book club, the ability to get together and talk about being queer and our own and other stories is just as valuable to the community as a safe and fun night out. I would also collaborate with BAME officers to arrange exclusively BAME Queer socials.
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									I also will be pushing to have some spaces facilitated for the creation of art and performance, I want to hold regular: painting nights, writing lunches, scratch nights, improv workshops etc for Queer people to get together and share ideas and work on whatever they want to without the pressures of assessment or expectation.
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									I would like to create and sustain a community within central that also supports each other outside of uni. My aim is to create an atmosphere in which, if a student wants to go to, for example, a space where they would feel more comfortable if supported by another queer person, they know somebody at Central that could go with them.
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									I do not want queer belonging and solidarity to begin and end with facilitated workshops, I want to create an organic community that sustains itself and is a constant source of support both during and after student’s time at Central.
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									I will be a friendly and approachable face around the university, and I will be open to talk to you about anything, to be on your side and fight in your corner on whatever issues may arise.

								<h5>Aims for the year</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>As LGBTQ+ Officer I want to create more space/events for Queer representation in and around the university. As we are theatre and performance students, I think this should be our medium to share our queerness</li>
									<li>LGBTQ+ complaints procedure in place to protect the voices of queer folk in our university and report any issues or concerns that can be followed up by the LGBTQ+ support system</li>
									<li>Support systems in place to help and follow up on any and all LGBTQ+ phobia on or off campus, that can be assessed and taken to the appropriate authority in our institution or out with if necessary</li>
									<li>Many events celebrating and education about the LGBTQ+ experience and LGBTQ+ life during LGBTQ+ History Month (February 2022)</li>
									<li>I’d very much want to work closely with the International Officer’s and the Black and Ethnic Minorities Officer to explore and celebrate the voices of those who are both LGBTQ+ and are part of the international and black and ethnic majority communities at our university</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="card-text">
									I will be running for the position of LGBTQ+ Officer in this By-Election as I was genuinely shocked and worried at the fact our institution didn’t have a Queer representative to support the LGBTQ+ students and community.<br> 
									Being a Gay man and a member of the LGBTQ+ community I want to step up to the challenge and make a change at Central by amplifying the voices of out large and beautiful Queer Community through various different methods.<br>
									I want to create space for queer performance to happen more regularly at Central as I think this is an extremely powerful tool as an act of intervention to the heteronormative world, we live in. We should express out artistic talents more and more.<br>
									I want for individuals who are part of the LGBTQ+ community to be able to gain support regarding any form of complaint made due to their identity and for this to be taken seriously by Central. Any form of phobic comments or actions are not tolerated ever and if they do occur then there must be consequences and I as LGBTQ+ officer would make sure of this.<br>
									As LGBTQ+ officer I want for there to be diversity and accessibility for Queer people in their time at Central be that in class or at a social event. I intend on making a change here by working closely with other officers to see what can be done for individuals who are a part of many different communities as I think an intersection approach to being LGBTQ+ Officer is the only for true and meaningful change to take place at Central.

I identify as someone part of the south asian queer community which at times has been challenging, however, always a prideful and honouring feeling, hehe!
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									I am someone who strongly believes in the equal representation, portrayal of individualism and celebration of differences that make up who we are. I hope and aim that this year as a collective we can create an environment where each one of us feels supported, empowered and capable of sharing vital, valuable stories, as well as inform others of the fluidity, range, inclusiveness and diversity involved within being apart of a community as such.

								<p class="card-text">
									Being authentic to yourself is something that never comes easy, but like all amazing things in life, the process is just as important as the finalised product. Finding a place or group of people that will fully embrace and give you the hype you deserve as a human being is something each and every single one of us deserves and so with all involved I aim to create somewhere we are able to openly communicate and share, ensuring any necessary support required is accessible. Here for the VIBBESSSSS and of course every wholesome, meaningful and important moment that comes with it.

								<p class="card-text">
									I am running for the position of your LGBTQ+ Officer at Central because I, to put it simply, want to be able to make sure the queer community within this institute is safe and most important celebrated. Having grown up in a working-class background and being unsure of who I am made me realise how important this role would be to me to allow me to make smaller changes to benefit the wider outreach of students at Central. To give you a little insight into who I am, I have been openly queer for five years and most of this was through secondary school – which you can probably guess wasn’t the most enjoyable experience I have faced to date. However, if I was to gain your vote, I will use being the “odd one out” and flip it on its head and use my platform in and around Central in a positive way. Through this I intend to make Central an inclusive building who learn from small changes made by students to help benefit them as an institute. I, was lucky in a sense that growing up I had the support of <em>Mosaic Trust</em> whom take a lot of credit for the person I have built and I want to make sure that all people of Central are represented, have someone to talk to and someone – most importantly – that can advocate for themselves and the student body as a whole without gaslighting and being authentic. In my belief, I think these aims will have a positive impact at Central because we need to use our ‘young’ voices and teach people about the different sexuality and gender identities and not be rebuked by anyone as we are VALID. I want to make Central have a learning curve and be able to suit and accommodate everybody’s needs as a queer person and help them be insighted into the issues that we, as individuals and a community, face.

I would like to create a group for trans and non-binary people to meet and get to know each other. I am to provide training for both staff and students on how to use inclusive language, how to be respectful of other people’s pronouns and what to do if you or someone else gets them wrong. I will be as informative as possible for anyone trans or cis, who has questions or is seeking advice. I will also work closely with the LGBTQ+ officer to provide the best support possible for trans students, and liaise with other trans student groups to find ways to improve things for the wider trans community. I also want to remind people that being trans does not always have to be a struggle, and provide a safe space for trans people to share their job and creativity.</p>
