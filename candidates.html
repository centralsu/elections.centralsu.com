								<h5>Aims for the year</h5>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Start something new:</strong> To ask the student body what new societies they would like to see and work collaboratively in the creation of them</li>
									<li><strong>Creating communities:</strong> Work with other officers on creating events to repair the community within Central</li>
									<li><strong>Back to normal:</strong> To get the societies that existed pre-COVID up and running again</li>
									<li><strong>Keeping going:</strong> Ensure all societies have prolonged success by remaining in close contact with the presidents</li>
									<li><strong>Spreading the word:</strong> Have a key focus on advertising and promoting societies</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Hey! We’re Mia and Kate, pronouns both she/her! We’re aware that life at a drama school can be full on, demanding and full of many hours spent slaving away in a studio. We believe there needs to be some respite from this; some time that is spent doing something else that we enjoy, but doing it purely for fun! The societies at Central have the potential to be that respite for students, and we want to make them more of a priority within the school.<br><br>
								Societies are a place where any course and year can come together and dedicate time to something where there is a mutual enjoyment. We are aware that there is often a divide between courses and that was made even more prominent in the last year with the COVID pandemic. Each course had been physically made to stay apart from each other for over a year, and we want to help integrate everybody again. These societies can massively help with getting people to meet each other and create connections between courses. We have seen through working with the football team this year that these societies have the potential to create new connections and friendships, in this instance, between the players and supporters. We want to make sure that this support remains throughout the season, as well as getting the netball team up and running again, and to make sure they have an equal amount of support!<br><br>
								We also recognise that the societies often don’t have much advertisement, therefore not many people know what is on offer and don’t get to make the most of them. We want to make sure everybody knows what is available and we also want students to be able to come to us and propose other societies that they would like; we will be here to support them and help them get started!</p>

								<p>CJ is a first year student on BA drama, applied theatre and education. Have a question? <a href="mailto:cordelia.lightfoot-jennings@cssd.ac.uk?subject=Candidate question">Contact CJ via email</a>.</p>
								<h5>Aims for the year</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>Increased accessibility</li>
									<li>Promotion of creative opportunities</li>
									<li>Connectivity</li>
									<li>Encouragement of sustainability</li>
									<li>Making the most of our time at Central</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Hi everyone! I’m CJ and I will be runinng for the role of activities officer.<br><br>
								Before we get onto the more serious manifesto points I’ll tell you three random racts that you don’t need to know;<br><br>
								- I refuse the watch Christmas films before November (proper bad luck I promise)<br>
								- I did baby hiphop and won world with a cheeky little Beyonce piece<br>
								- I used to drive a yellow Corsa that set on fire while I was driving it (always check you coolant fluid kids)<br><br>
								Unnecessary but the more you know, I guess.<br><br>
								Now, more than ever, the positive mental wellbeing of students should be of top priority and so I aim to promote connectivity at Central. I want to create a space in which everyone has the opportunity to feel heard.<br><br>
								I wish to work with the Environments Officer to encourage sustainability – even small changes can make a huge difference.<br><br>
								Increased accessibility is so important and so I want to try and ensure all students feel that there are options which they truly wish to participate in. This is an ideal time in our lives to try new things in a forward-thinking environment that could shape who we become.<br><br>
								I want to promote new creative experiences that are unique to Central. We are all in this together and so I wan to be a point of contact for anyone with an idea for a new society, event or charity fundraiser so that everyone has a chance to communicate their ideas.<br><br>
								The next 3+ years of our life are so excitign and so I want to contribute to this by providing an outlet from all our hard work where we can simply make the most of it all.<br><br>
								One point that has recently come to the attention of the media is the increased rates of spiking in clubs and the dangerous methods of spiking now occuring. For everyone’s saety I think this point needs to be addressed and so I want to increase awareness and discover new prevention methods so that we can all enjoy nightlife without fearing for our safety. This is a very important matter to me and so if elected, it will be one of my first points made.<br><br>
								Thanks for reading :)<br>
								CJ</p>
